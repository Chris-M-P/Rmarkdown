## Embed a plot

Here's an embedded plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, 
                       y = hwy, 
                       colour = drv)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

```


## Embed a table

Here's an embedded table

```{r, results="asis"}
library(arsenal)
table_one <- tableby(drv ~ hwy + class, 
                     data = mpg, 
                     test=TRUE, 
                     total=TRUE)
summary(table_one)
```


## Inline R code

We included `r nrow(mpg)` cars from the mpg dataset in our analyses. The mean fuel consumption of these cars was `r round(mean(mpg$hwy), 3)` mpg (sd = `r round(sd(mpg$hwy), 3)`).
